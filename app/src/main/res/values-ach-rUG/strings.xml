    <string name="intro_welcome">Welcome!</string>
    <string name="intro_welcome_desc">Your Android device probably has a lot of settings to change, but did you know there\'s a lot of settings that are hidden? This app helps you change those hidden settings! You don\'t need root access, but you do have to follow a few steps to set this app up.</string>
    <string name="intro_terms">Terms of Use</string>
    <string name="intro_terms_desc">Please read these terms. I promise they\'re worthwhile. For most of you, they\'ll save you an email.</string>
    <string name="intro_disclaimer">Disclaimer</string>
    <string name="intro_disclaimer_desc">SystemUI Tuner can change hidden settings. Unfortunately, since they\'re hidden, there\'s a chance that your particular device won\'t respond to certain changes. On heavily customized versions of Android, such as EMUI, MIUI, and ColorOS, there will be a lot of features that simply don\'t work. Please keep in mind that there\'s simply nothing I can do about this.</string>
    <string name="intro_grant_wss">Grant Write Secure Settings</string>
    <string name="intro_grant_wss_desc">SystemUI Tuner needs a special permission to work. To grant it, you either need to use ADB or be rooted. Pressing GRANT below will attempt to use root to grant the permission. Otherwise, hit the HELP button, and we\'ll help you get ADB set up. Don\'t worry, though; ADB is perfectly safe to use. You won\'t void your warranty, trip Samsung Knox, root your phone, or unlock the bootloader.</string>
    <string name="intro_grant_extra">Grant Extra Permissions</string>
    <string name="intro_grant_extra_desc">For certain features, SystemUI Tuner needs some extra ADB permissions to work properly. You don\'t have to grant these now, and you\'ll be prompted if they\'re needed.</string>
    <string name="intro_system_alert_window">System Alert Window</string>
    <string name="intro_system_alert_window_desc">Android 12 and later have significantly restricted the ability for apps to run operations in the background and when the device boots. Granting SystemUI Tuner permission to display over other apps will exempt it from these restrictions and improve the reliability of Persistent Options. This permission is completely optional.</string>
    <string name="intro_allow_notifications">Allow Notifications</string>
    <string name="intro_allow_notifications_desc">Android 13 introduces a new restriction on apps requiring permission from the user to display notifications.
